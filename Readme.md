# Redistribution and Equality of Opportunity

This folder contains the code and data for the ongoing project _Equality of Opportunity vs Equality of Outcomes:
A Theory of Optimal Redistribution_.

## Contents
* _/Replications/Saez-2001_: Data files and code to replicate the results of the Mirrlees model in Saez (2001). The replication is functional but may be streamlined in the future.
* _/Replications/Kleven-Best_: Data files and code to replicate the results of the Mirrlees model in Kleven and Best (2012). This replicates the $\delta = 0$, age-dependent version of the model.
